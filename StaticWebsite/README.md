# Cloud-Resume-Challenge

The goal of this Cloud resume challenge was to build a resume online. Since I recently complete my AZ103 & AZ305 certification. I decided to take this challenge on as a way to bolster up my Azure skills. Working on a project is the best way to build once skills. You often run into problems or challenges that google your way out :) by diving deeper into the technology, thereby building knowledge.
